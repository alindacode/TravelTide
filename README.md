# TravelTide
E-booking startup TravelTide is a hot new player in the online travel industry. It has experienced steady growth since it was founded at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic (2021-04) on the strength of its data aggregation and search technology, which is best in class.
## Introduction
Following the startup playbook, TravelTide has maintained a hyper-focus on building an unfair advantage along a limited number of dimensions - in this case, building the biggest travel inventory and making it easily searchable. Because of this narrow focus, certain aspects of the TravelTide customer experience are underdeveloped, resulting in poor customer retention. CEO Kevin Talanick is very motivated to retain and add value to existing customers with a Marketing strategy built on a solid understanding of customer behavior.
Elena Tarrant, the new Head of Marketing, has been brought on to supercharge the Marketing efforts at TravelTide. She is well known in the Marketing community as an expert in customer retention strategies, specifically rewards programs, an advanced feature proven to generate repeat business if executed well. 
## The Problem
Elenaâ€™s mission is to design and execute a fantastic personalized rewards program that keeps customers returning to the TravelTide platform. It is difficult to personalize rewards for customers without first understanding them, so for the project to be successful, Elena will need to lean on the data team for customer insights. She needs our help to validate the fact that the perks she has in mind will attract customers and also that we should assign them to segments according to what we think is their favourite perk.
